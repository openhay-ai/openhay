## Frontend â€” Setup and Deployment

This guide covers setting up and deploying the Vite/React frontend.

---

### 1. Local Development

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (v18+)
- A running backend API

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm ci
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**
    Create a `.env` file from the example and add your backend API URL.
    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```
    Inside `.env`, set the following variable:
    ```env
    # Example for a local backend running on port 8000
    VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**
    Start the Vite dev server, which will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

This project is configured to deploy automatically on Railway using Nixpacks and Caddy.

**Steps:**

1.  **Push to GitHub**
    Ensure your latest code is committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

2.  **Create a New Railway Project**
    - In your Railway dashboard, select "New Project" and choose "Deploy from GitHub repo".
    - Select your repository.
    - When prompted for a service root, enter `frontend`.

3.  **Configure Service Variables**
    - In your new Railway service, go to the "Variables" tab.
    - Add the `VITE_API_BASE` variable and set it to your deployed backend's public URL.
    ```
    VITE_API_BASE=https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app
    ```
    Railway will automatically build and deploy the service. The build and start commands are defined in `nixpacks.toml` and do not need to be set manually.

4.  **Access Your Site**
    Once the deployment is complete, use the URL generated by Railway to access your live application.
