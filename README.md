## About The Project

[AIHay.vn](https://ai-hay.vn/) is a prominent Vietnamese startup that recently [raised over $10M in funding](https://news.tuoitre.vn/vietnamese-ai-startup-raises-10mn-in-series-a-funding-103250703165541286.htm) for its generative AI-powered knowledge platform.

**OpenHay** is an open-source implementation of its core features, developed by 2 engineers. The goal is to provide a powerful, self-hostable AI companion that is free to use for anyone with their own API keys, removing the need for a paid subscription.

## Core Features

-   **Q&A with Citations**: Delivers reliable, LLM-generated answers with citations extracted from web sources.
-   **Daily News Gathering**: An autonomous agent crawls predefined Vietnamese news sites, using an LLM to select and summarize the most significant articles. For technical details, see the [**Discover Agent README**](./backend/core/agents/discover/README.md).
-   **Deep Research Agent**: A hierarchical, multi-agent system for conducting in-depth, autonomous research. It parallelizes web investigation across multiple sub-agents and synthesizes their findings into a final, cited report. This system is optimized for performance and cost-efficiency using `gemini-2.5-flash`. For a detailed architectural breakdown, read the [**Research Agent README**](./backend/core/agents/research/README.md).
-   **Translation**: Translates content from web links or uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) while preserving context and technical terms.

## Getting Started

To deploy a local instance, follow the setup instructions in the respective directories:

-   **[Backend Setup](./backend/README.md)**
-   **[Frontend Setup](./frontend/README.md)**

The system operates on a "bring-your-own-key" model. You will need API keys for services like Google AI (for Gemini models), Brave API (for web search) which typically offer a free tier sufficient for personal use.
